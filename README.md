# baseXencoder

This is a simple encoder tool that will implement RFC 4648 which defines standards for base16, 
base32, and base64 encodings.

The purpose of this project is to simply write some C code because I haven't done any in over a year.

I'm rolling my own unit test code because I don't want to spend time learning a framework
when I'm just interested in keeping the dust off my basic C knowledge.
